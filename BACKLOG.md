# Ipanema work queue

The scheduled worker takes the first item marked `[ ]`, does it, ticks it `[x]` with a one-line result, commits, and stops.

## Rules (Daniel's, non-negotiable)
- **No Modal spend without Daniel's explicit "go" in chat.** This includes anything under $1. The worker only uses this machine and the free GitHub runner (`triggers/free.txt`, `triggers/playerbench.txt`, `triggers/nightly.txt`).
- Prove offline first. Test before running (a dry run with stand-in models, plus the `tests/` suite). Nothing replaces a better model unless it scores better.
- Every change gets a test. Results go into `results/`, committed.
- If an item needs money or a decision, write it under "Waiting for Daniel" and move on.
- Plain, short language in anything Daniel reads.

## Queue (priority order)
- [ ] B1. Ball picker: add "ball with player P" (possession state) as a candidate (results/research/ball_2026-09-28.md, item 1). Grade with tools/picklab.py on the 34 moments; report "a guess was on the ball" and "right pick" separately.
- [ ] B2. Look below the cut-off: at the 8 moments with no guess on the ball, do the finders see the ball weakly? Needs raw heatmaps (only on Modal) -> write what is needed under "Waiting for Daniel".
- [ ] P1. Spånga striped kits: check the re-run (results/qa/tracktest_p15u-vs-spanga-2026-09-25) after the track-vote change; if players are still missing, find out why and fix, re-test on all grounds.
- [ ] B3. Prepare SoccerTrack v2 ball labels in pixels (repo script scripts/calibration/project_tracking_to_image.py, ground balls only, check the known y-flip problems). Free runner, HF_TOKEN secret. Output: crops + labels ready for training, plus a picture sheet to check projection.
- [ ] B4. Grow the ball answer key from 34 to 300+ moments without Daniel clicking: frames where both finders AND the picker agree with high confidence, plus a check sheet Claude grades by eye.
- [ ] N1. Every morning: read results/nightly/<date>.md, and if anything got worse than the day before, put it at the top of this queue.

## Waiting for Daniel
(nothing yet)

## Done
- [x] 28 Sep: new player pipeline (RF-DETR + per-match kits + gap filling + keeper + duplicates): full SFK-BP clip, dark players tracked 1.5 -> 4.1 s, light 0.7 -> 7.0 s.
